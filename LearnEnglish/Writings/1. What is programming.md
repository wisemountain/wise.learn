# what is programming

The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task on a computer, often for solving a given problem. 

I view programming as transforms of data. Data represents problem domain, and transformation is an algorithm and a operation on data. 

These data and operations make a type. Type is a set of data and operations on data. 
Type also can be viewed as data, and compiler sees them as data. template meta programming uses types to transform types. 

## examples

### rendering 

data: 
 - light 
 - surface 
 - camera

transform into: 
 - 2d surface of pixels 

### rigid body physics 

data: 
 - shape
 - force 

transform into: 
 - position
 - rotation

## Abstract Data Type 

I first met ADT from an algorithm book. But it can be extended for any problem, and it is  programming. 

Category theory uses object(data) and arrow (transform). It seems to be a promising abstraction and it has been used by programming language researchers. 

I don't want to study category theory. Instead, I will use data / operation view and going into that direction to identify the structure of problems that I need to solve, the code that I write.

## goal 

- Make Feynman's style mine. 
- Learn Physics and transform into a program.

How to transform Physics, a description of nature, into a program? 
- visualize as much as possible. 
- build a numerical system to calculate physical configurations. 

Combining those two direction into one makes a visualized physical system simulator. 
This is the main focus of modern physical applications. They do experiments, gather data, and simulate with the results. They use the simulation to get theoretical insights. 

I'm not going into that direction, instead I do it as a hobby with a little exercise in programming. 

## Introduction 

The test of all knowlege is experiment. 

Where do the knowledge come from? 
- experiment
- observation 
- imagination 
- reasoning

Laws of nature are approximate. Probability rules. 

when we later concentrate on some particualr point we will have some idea of the background, 
why that particular point is interesting, and how it fits into the big structure. 

So, what is our overall picture of the world? 

## Matter is made of atoms 

all things are made of atoms - little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. 

The above sentence draws a picture of particles - atoms - moving them around. This is the way of stating ideas by Feynman. 

We can also ask the same question on programming or on AI. 

What is the one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? 

> Programming is a transformation of data.

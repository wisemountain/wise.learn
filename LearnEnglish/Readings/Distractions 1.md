# Distractions

I decided to read articles or books in English to extend vocabulary and make my style of writing. First, I came to nature site and found it is not free. So I changed the main source of articles to wikepedia and distracted to Richard Feynman's physics book site. 

Wikepedia has billions of articles ranging over lots of fields, and its structure is a graph, a graph with tons of edges and vertices. Therefore the title came distrctions. 

It is very pleasing to read in this style, and I figured out that I really love physics and mathematics. Fortunately I am a programmer for living and programming requires physics (to some degree) and mathematics (more than physics). 

Following is the original goal:
> I decided to write documents in English to make npang products present in global market. 
> Reading is one of the best tools to extend vocabulary and to learn good styles. 

> Nature has articles focusing scientific issues and discoveries. It can show the way to
> deliver facts with style. Unfortunately, however, it is not free. 

> Wikipedia has billions of articles. The styles of articles are diverse since people 
> spreading all over the world are participating and editing them. 

> Wikepedia has Random article menu and it brings a random article. This can be an easy 
> starting point to read and learn.

Reading the graph of computer science. Let's flow. 


## Computer science

CS is the study of processes that interact with data and that can be represented as data in the form of programs. 

A computer scientist studies the theory of computation and the design of software systems. 


## compuer science/complex system

complex systems are systems whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment 


## compuer science/complex system/system 

A system is a group of interacting or interrelated entities that form a unified whole. 
Systems are the subjects of study of systems theory. 

System came from `composition` literary. Yes. composition, spatial and temporal relations are very important view to construct and analyze sytems. 


### Concepts 

**environment and boundaries**

Boundary is a knife that cuts the system into inside and outside. One large system can consist of smaller systems. Here a knife (a concept or conditions) cuts the system into parts. 

What makes a knife in software? Facade is a one way to construct a large system with smaller components. Component pattern itself is another way. Any method needs to clarify the logic or condition enough for programmers who use the system or maintain (code to evolve the system) it.

**Theoretical framework**

open systems and closed systems. There are some concepts useful, but they are not detailed here.  Open system has input and output. 

Class can be viewed as a system having multiple input and output pairs. Complexity arises when the transformation of input to output involves side effects, which change internal state of the class. This change can also change the output of the same input after the specific invocation of one input. This makes the system input order dependent.    


## computer science / complex system / system / systems modeling 

Systems modeling or system modeling is the interdisciplinary study of the use of models to conceptualize and construct systems in business and IT development. 

function modeling: Function flow block diagram and IDEF0. 

architectural modeling: systems architecture to conceptually model the structure, behavior, and more views of a system. 

Business process modeling notation: a graphical representation for specifying business processes in a workflow, can also be considered to be a systems modeling language. 


## systems modeling / agent-based model 

Higher-level system properties emerge from the interactions of lower-level subsystems. 

Indivisual agents are typically characterized as boundedly rational, presumed to be acting in what they perceive as their own interests, such as reproduction, economic benefit, or social status, using heuristics or simple decision-making rules. 


## von neumann : The role of high and of extremely high complication 

Some sentences. What is von neumann's style? 

It makes an enormous difference where a computing machine is designed, say, for more or less typical problems of mathematical analysis, or for number theory, or combinatorics, or for translating a text. 

We have an approximate idea of how to design a machine to handle the typical general problems of mathematical analysis. I think we have very little idea as to how to design good machines for combinatorics and translation. 

It is therefore quite possible that we are not too far from the limits of complication which can be achieved in artificial automata without really fundamental insights into a theory of information, although one should be very careful with such statements because they can sound awfully ridiculous 5 years later. 

Neumann uses plain english. I think it is from his flow of thinking. He thinks, then it is logical and plain. Other reason can be that he is a hungarian emmigrant to USA. But I don't think it would not be the main reason. 

What I need to learn from his style is the plainness. clear, simple and correct word with simple stentence. 


## Feynmann : reading the book 

### Electronmagnetism

Electrical forces: 

Consider a force like gravitation which varies predominantly inversely as the square of the distance, but which is about a billion-billion-billion-billion times stronger. 

Imagination, travelling are the words that hit me when I first saw the above stentence from Feynman lecture. 

That's the electric force!

There are two kinds of "matter", which we can call positive and negative. Like kinds repel and unlike kinds attract - unlike gravity where there in only attraction. What would happen? 

Yes. Travelling. Wandering into the world of electromanetism. Physics are on forces.   

Depicting. It is like a drawing a picture. Imagination explods and it becomes a cartoon, a person pulling the earth with electric force. 

Questions. It brings mind to a subject. It makes focusing by thinking. 
Questions are harmless. 

I like Feynman style since I am a person of imagination and a traveller in life. 

$ F = q( E + v x B) $

 - E : electric field 
 - B : magnetic field 



## Vocabulary 


- etymology : the study of the origin and history of words, or a study of this type relating to one particular word. 

 > At university she developed and interest in etymology
 > A list of selected words and their etymologies is printed at the back of the book.
